# Arduino-Weather-Station
Create an Arduino Based Weather Station

## Project Overview

The Arduino Weather Station is a real-time environmental monitoring system that I created as a solo project. This project utilizes temperature and humidity sensors, a real-time clock (RTC) module, a light sensor, and a pressure/altitude sensor to monitor real-time environmental data. The goal was to design and program a fully functional Arduino-based weather station, with a Rust API that serves as a backend for the weather station application. It handles incoming weather data and provides endpoints to retrieve and query the stored information. This project was done to demonstrate proficiency in programming languages like C/C++, Rust, SQL, and web development, while also showcasing skills in sensor integration and microcontroller programming.


## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity.
- Data acquisition and processing algorithms for interpreting sensor data.
- Web interface for accessing and displaying real-time weather data.
- Version control using Git for project management.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- ESP8266 WiFi module.
- Temperature and humidity sensors (e.g., DHT22 or DHT11).
- Real-time clock (RTC) module (e.g., DS3231).
- A light sensor (e.g., BH1750).
- A pressure/altitude sensor (e.g., BMP180).
- Wiring and connectors.
- Power supply.

## Software Requirements

The software components and tools used in this project include:

- PlatformIO IDE for firmware development.
- C++ programming for Arduino firmware.
- JavaScript and HTML/CSS for the web interface.
- Rust programming for the backend API.
- SQLite for the database.
- Git for version control.
