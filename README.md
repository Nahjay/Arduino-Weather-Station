# Arduino-Weather-Station
Create an Arduino Based Weather Station

## Project Overview

The Arduino Weather Station is a real-time environmental monitoring system that I created as a solo project. This project utilizes temperature and humidity sensors, a real-time clock (RTC) module, and an LCD display to provide real-time environmental data. The goal was to design and program a fully functional Arduino-based weather station, demonstrating proficiency in programming languages like C/C++, Python, and web development, while also showcasing skills in sensor integration and microcontroller programming.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity.
- Display of environmental conditions on an LCD screen.
- Data acquisition and processing algorithms for interpreting sensor data.
- Web interface for accessing and displaying real-time weather data.
- Version control using Git for project management.
- Containerization with Docker for portability and ease of deployment.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- Temperature and humidity sensors (e.g., DHT22 or DHT11).
- Real-time clock (RTC) module (e.g., DS3231).
- LCD display.
- Wiring and connectors.
- Power supply.

## Software Requirements

The software components and tools used in this project include:

- Arduino IDE for firmware development.
- C and C++ programming for Arduino firmware.
- JavaScript and HTML for the web interface.
- Git for version control.
- Docker for containerization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:


2. Connect the hardware components following the wiring diagram provided in the documentation.

3. Upload the Arduino firmware to your Arduino microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

1. Power up the Arduino Weather Station.
2. Access the web interface to view real-time weather data. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:your_port` (replace `your_port` with the port number specified in your configuration).
3. The LCD display will also provide on-site weather information.

## Contributing

This is a solo project, and contributions are not currently accepted. However, you are welcome to fork the repository and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
